multi peak finding procedure:

1) find a peak absolute value
2) find the first occurance of peak-tolerance to either side, or the end values if reached
3) use 3rd order polynomial regression to approximate the peak region and find the approximate peak position and value
4) repeat the above, excluding all previous peak regions - if a peak region is reached before peak-tol is reached, the current peak is discarded (optionally discarded only if both ends are blocked by previous peak regions
5) stop when no more peak regions can be found
