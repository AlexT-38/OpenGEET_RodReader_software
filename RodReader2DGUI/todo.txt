so it looks like I need to do one or more of the following:

1) data smoothing
	average each data point with its adjacent points to smooth the curve
	this can be done on the raw data or the adjusted data
	this may also require some normalization so that recursive smoothing oesnt affect the absolute values
2) statistical analasys
	not to repeat readings and take an sd and look for high error in the peak values: impractical
	at the very least, I need to check for a long run of peak values, and find the centre
	I could graph the rate of change, smooth that and use the zero crossing points


so, things to definately do, in order of priority:

1) look for runs of peak values
2) make the peak-peak function run from a button
3) draw the adjusted data as a continuous line
4) add pan and zoom controls
5) plot the change in values
6) add smoothing, selective between raw, adj, delta
7) best fit on delta
8) peak2peak on best fit delta

priority change


1) draw the adjusted data as a continuous line 		-done
2) plot the change in values 				-done.... but just copies input data
3) make the peak-peak function run from a button, and print values to GUI -done (prints length only)
4) look for runs of peak values, use centre of run	- done, but need to add tolerance
5) add pan and zoom controls				- done but clunky
6) add smoothing, selective between raw, adj, delta	- done: avg of running average in both dirs
7) best fit on delta
8) peak2peak on best fit delta

quickly added rectangles to show hi and lon ranges, plus p2p region

priority:

1) add tolerance to hi/lo ranging
2) fix delta curve
3) p2p based on delta

17:09 (after lunch)

tolerance added
scaled rectangle for drawing p2p regions fixed


17:38

tolerance working incorrectly:
the start point is ok, but the end point it 'tol' less than that.
need to change so that the same value is used for start and end of peak region
then I need to do something like a centre of mass calclation
say, for each point in the region, calculate the average of points prior to that one,
 and the average of points after it and take the point at which the average before equals the average after
checking wiki.....
bleh, no help at all
lets just get the basic tolerance system working, then graphically investigate the result

things to do

replace pan slider with joystick

collect all three axis at once
set toggles for viewing the raw data and processed data
set toggles for viewing axis

draw rod
manual point entry and data readout
zero crossing length

polynomial best fit for detirmining rod length
